# Bangalore Home Price Estimator

This practice project aims to predict real estate prices in Bangalore using machine learning. The model leverages linear regression and the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.

## Key Concepts and Techniques

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: The dataset is first loaded, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.
- **Outlier Detection & Removal**: Identified and removed outliers that could negatively affect the model's accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied various feature engineering techniques to enhance the dataset.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduced the feature space to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Implemented cross-validation to assess the model's performance.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
- `sklearn` for model building and evaluation
